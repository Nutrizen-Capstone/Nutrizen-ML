# Nutrizen Machine Learning Models


Nutrizen Machine Learning (Nutrizen-ML) is the machine learning component of the Nutrizen project. It provides the models used for caloric content recognition in food items within the Nutrizen Android app.

## Overview

Nutrizen-ML leverages machine learning models to accurately identify and classify food items, allowing users to conveniently obtain caloric information through image scanning.

## Models

The repository contains pre-trained models using TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) for deployment. These models have been trained on a diverse set of food images to ensure robust performance.

- **Calorie Recognition Model**: Identifies and predicts the caloric content of scanned food items.

## Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow
- **Deployment**: TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)

## How to Use

To use Nutrizen-ML in your Nutrizen Android app, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nutrizen-Capstone/Nutrizen-ML.git
   ```

2. Integrate the TensorFlow Lite models into your Android app by placing them in the appropriate directory.

3. Use the provided inference code in your Android app to make predictions based on the models.

## Training (Optional)

If you need to retrain or fine-tune the models, refer to the training section in the respective model directories.
